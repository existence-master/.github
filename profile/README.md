# Philosophy

In a world often characterized by segmented efforts to serve specific aspects of existence, our club envisions a paradigm shift – a departure from the conventional focus on humanity alone. Our philosophy centers around the upliftment of every form of existence, acknowledging the interconnectedness and interdependence that defines the fabric of our reality. Rather than limiting our efforts to the welfare of humanity, we embrace a holistic approach that encompasses all living beings, the environment, and even non-living entities.

Our philosophy emphasizes the intricate web of interconnectedness that binds all forms of existence. The health and prosperity of humanity are inseparable from the well-being of the environment, the welfare of diverse ecosystems, and the delicate balance that extends to the non-living components of our world. Central to our vision is a commitment to sustainability and regeneration.

We celebrate the diversity inherent in all forms of existence, recognizing that each contributes to the rich tapestry of life. Inclusivity is not confined to humanity; it extends to the myriad expressions of existence, fostering an environment where every entity is valued and empowered.

As advocates for technological advancement, we believe in harnessing innovation to harmonize with the natural world. Our technological endeavors prioritize solutions that benefit all forms of existence, avoiding the pitfalls of progress that lead to the degradation of our planet and its inhabitants.

Our club embraces an ethical responsibility that transcends human-centric perspectives. We acknowledge the inherent rights of all forms of existence and commit to ethical practices that safeguard the well-being of every entity. At Existence, our vision is to push the boundaries of technology to shape the future of existence. We're dedicated to creating groundbreaking products that redefine how we perceive and interact with the world.

In ushering in a new era focused on existence itself, our club seeks to redefine the boundaries of compassion, responsibility, and progress. By embracing the interconnected nature of all forms of existence, we aspire to contribute to a future where upliftment knows no bounds, extending its benevolent reach to every facet of our shared reality.

# Project Selection Criteria

Looking at the above philosophy, we can envision a broad set of ideas that we can execute. But the probability of submitting to wishful thinking is quite high in such grand visions. Hence, here follows a criteria that defines some rules for project selection.

Certainly, here are the three specific rules for project selection at the club:

1. **Alignment With Holistic Philosophy:** Projects must align with our holistic approach, contributing to the upliftment and well-being of all forms of existence, including living beings, the environment, and non-living entities.

2. **Open Source Compatibility:** Selected projects should have the potential for open-sourcing, promoting transparency, collaboration, and the sharing of knowledge. This ensures that our contributions have a wider impact and benefit the broader community.

3. **Monetization Feasibility:** Projects should demonstrate a clear path for monetization without compromising the ethical and holistic principles of our philosophy. Sustainable revenue models that support the continued development and impact of the project are essential.

4. **Impact:** Projects we undertake should have a wider impact than our locality. We need to define clear ways to scale the project aiming towards maximum impact.

A special task will be assigned to a team or individual to always check that any working project fits these rules.

# How It Feels At Existence

At our club, the atmosphere is defined by a spirit of camaraderie, openness, and a shared commitment to our holistic philosophy. Unlike traditional structures, we embrace a flat and egalitarian environment, dismantling hierarchies to ensure every member's voice is valued equally. Here, friendliness and inclusivity are not just ideals but the very essence of our community, fostering genuine connections that extend beyond project boundaries.

Freedom of expression is a cornerstone, allowing members, regardless of background or experience, to contribute ideas and actively shape the direction of our collective endeavors. Dedication to our shared mission is paramount, emphasizing a commitment to the diligent pursuit of projects that contribute meaningfully to our overarching philosophy. In our supportive environment, challenges with time management or distractions are met with collective support, viewing obstacles as shared responsibilities.

Our club is not just a collaborative workspace; it's a community united by a passion for upliftment and a dedication to creating positive impacts, where every member plays an integral role in the journey towards our shared vision. There is no hierarchy here and we should try our best to not create one. There is just distribution of tasks and leadership and that distribution is always bound to change. Know that this club is not about any specific project, person or concept. It is about existence. And existence must go on.
