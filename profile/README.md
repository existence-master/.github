## Philosophy

At Existence, our mission is to innovate products that create a better future for all forms of life. We are committed to using sustainable development processes to create products that add value to the lives of our users.

## Product Selection Criteria

Looking at the above philosophy, we can envision a broad set of ideas that we can execute. But the probability of submitting to wishful thinking is quite high in such grand visions. Hence, here follows a criteria that defines some rules for project selection:

- **Alignment With Holistic Philosophy:** Projects must align with our holistic approach, contributing to the upliftment and well-being of all forms of existence, including living beings, the environment, and non-living entities.
- **Open Source Compatibility:** Selected projects should have the potential for open-sourcing, promoting transparency, collaboration, and the sharing of knowledge. This ensures that our contributions have a wider impact and benefit the broader community. Various business models can be explored for balancing open source and proprietary software.
- **Monetization Feasibility:** Projects should demonstrate a clear path for monetization without compromising the ethical and holistic principles of our philosophy. Sustainable revenue models that support the continued development and impact of the project are essential.
- **Research Facility:** Selected projects should leverage our research facility to contribute to the generation of original ideas, advancements, and innovations. This may include conducting studies, publishing research papers, or exploring the potential for patenting unique concepts. The facility's resources should be used to drive the technical and scientific aspects of the project while maintaining a commitment to transparency and open knowledge sharing.
- **Impact:** Projects we undertake should have a wider impact than our locality. We need to define clear ways to scale the project aiming towards maximum impact.

A special task will be assigned to a team or individual to always check that any working product fits these rules.
